	<h2>Our Mission</h2>
	<p align="center">
	  We make researchers in science, engineering, and medicine more productive
	  by teaching them basic lab skills for scientific computing
	</p>
	<aside class="notes">
	  Our goal is to make scientists and engineers more productive by teaching them fundamental computational skills.

      <section class="slide">
	<h2>The Problem</h2>
	<ul>
	  <li>
	    Scientists spend more and more time building and using software
	  </li>
	  <li>
	    <em>Almost all are primarily self-taught</em>
	  </li>
	  <li>
	    Hard to measure how <em>well</em> they do things
	  </li>
	  <li>
	    But anecdotal evidence suggests "not very"
	  </li>
	</ul>
	<aside class="notes">
	  Multiple studies have shown that scientists spend
	  an increasing amount of time building and using software,
	  and that most of them are primarily self-taught.
	  While it's hard to measure their efficiency and productivity,
	  anecdotal evidence suggests that there's a lot of room for improvement.

	<h2>Our Solution</h2>
	<ul>
	  <li>
	    Scientists teaching scientists
	  </li>
	  <li>
	    Two days of hands-on learning
	  </li>
	</ul>
	<div align="center">
	  <table>
	    <tr>
	      <td>the Unix shell</td>
	      <td>&nbsp;&rArr;&nbsp;</td>
	      <td>automate repetitive tasks</td>

	<aside class="notes">
	  Software Carpentry is the solution.
	  We run intensive two-day classes that give scientists and engineers those fundamental skills.
	  In two full days,
	  we cover the basics of the Unix shell, version control with Git, programming in Python or R, and using SQL.
	  What we're really showing them though, is how to automate repetitive tasks,
	  how to track and share their work,
	  how to grow a program in a modular, testable, reusable way,
	  and the difference between structured and unstructured data.

	<h2>Outcomes</h2>
	<ul>
	  <li>
	    10-20% improvement in productivity is common
	  </li>
	  <li>
	    10X isn't rare
	  </li>
	  <li>
	    Do the old things faster
	  </li>
	  <li>
	    Tackle new problems
	  </li>
	  <li>
	    Ready for HPC, the cloud, big data, ...
	  </li>
	  <li>
	    Start <em>doing</em> open science
	  </li>
	</ul>
	<aside class="notes">
	  We can often save people 10 - 20% of their time
	  and it's not unusual for attendees to report a tenfold savings.
	  We also give people the technical skills they need to make use of
	  high-performance computing, the cloud, and other new possibilities,
	  and to play an active role in changing the way science itself is done.

	<h2>The Details</h2>
	<ul>
	  <li>
	    Materials are all open access
	  </li>
	  <li>
	    Instructors are volunteers
	  </li>
	  <li>
	    Host site pays for instructor travel and accommodation
	  </li>
	  <li>
	    Administrative fee to cover central costs if we're helping organize
	  </li>
	</ul>
	<aside class="notes">
	  Our notes and examples are all freely reusable under open licenses,
	  and our instructors are all volunteers,
	  so the only cost to host sites is their travel and accommodation
	  plus an administrative fee to cover instructor training, curriculum development, and so on
	  for workshops that we help to organize

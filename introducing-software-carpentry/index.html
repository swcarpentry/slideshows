	<h2>Our Mission</h2>
	<p align="center">
	  We make researchers in science, engineering, and medicine more productive
	  by teaching them basic lab skills for scientific computing
	</p>
	<aside class="notes">
	  Our goal is to make scientists and engineers more productive by teaching them fundamental computational skills.

	<h2>The Problem</h2>
	<ul>
	  <li>
	    Scientists spend 40% of their time building or using software
	  </li>
	  <li>
	    <em>96% are mostly self-taught</em>
	  </li>
	  <li>
	    No hard data on how <em>well</em> they do things
	  </li>
	  <li>
	    But anecdotal evidence suggests "not very"
	  </li>
	</ul>
	<aside class="notes">
	  They told us that on average they spend about 40% of their time building or using software.
	  53% told us that this number is going up.
	  And an astonishing 96% told us that they are mostly self-taught.
	  We weren't able to get any data on how productive or effective they are.
	  But the evidence we do have suggests that everything seems to take longer and hurt more than it should.

	<h2>Our Solution</h2>
	<ul>

	    Scientists teaching scientists

	    Two days of hands-on learning

	  Software Carpentry is the solution.
	  We run intensive two-day classes that give scientists and engineers those fundamental skills
	  as part of the <a href="http://mozillascience.org/">Mozilla Science Lab</a>.
	  Two full days covers the basics of the Unix shell, version control with Git, programming in Python or R, and using SQL.
	  What we're really showing them though, is how to automate repetitive tasks,
	  how to track and share their work,
	  how to grow a program in a modular, testable, reusable way,
	  and the difference between structured and unstructured data.

	<h2>Outcomes</h2>
	<ul>
	  <li>
	    20% improvement in productivity is common
	  </li>
	  <li>
	    10X isn't rare
	  </li>
	  <li>
	    Do the old things faster
	  </li>
	  <li>
	    Tackle new problems
	  </li>
	  <li>
	    Ready for HPC, the cloud, big data, ...
	  </li>
	  <li>
	    Start <em>doing</em> open science
	  </li>
	</ul>
	<aside class="notes">
	  We can often save people 20% of their time - a day a week -
	  and it's not unusual for attendees to report a tenfold savings.
	  We also give people the technical skills they need to make use of
	  high-performance computing, the cloud, and other new possibilities,
	  and to play an active role in changing the way science itself is done.

	<h2>The Details</h2>
	<ul>
	  <li>
	    Materials are all open access
	  </li>
	  <li>
	    Instructors are volunteers
	  </li>
	  <li>
	    Costs are:
	    <ul>
	      <li>Instructor travel and accommodation</li>
	      <li>Administration fee to cover central costs</li>
	    </ul>
	  </li>
	</ul>
	<aside class="notes">
	  Our notes and examples are all freely reusable under open licenses,
	  and our instructors are all volunteers,
	  so the only cost to host sites is their travel and accommodation
	  plus an administrative fee to cover instructor training, curriculum development, and so on.
